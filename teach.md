#Why I teach at a Rails Bootcamp
It seems that the rise of developer bootcamps(become a junior developer in 10
weeks etc..) continues to grow at an exponential rate. For many, this is a
chance to get into a field that they're passionate about but don't necessarily
have the time or money to go the 4 year CS major route. This seems to annoy
some, who seem to have the attitude that without the prerequisite 4 year degree
and $100000 student debt, that you can never be a developer. In their defence,
not everyone's learning style and pace is suited towards the bootcamp model(just
as not everyone is suited towards traditional education), and their are
definitely people graduating from bootcamps who are woefully underqualified for
the role of a junior developer. But at the same time, I challenge you to think
of any school that has a 100% success rate in producing successful programmers.
The truth of the matter is that their shouldn't be prejudice against those who
have graduated from development bootcamps if they have the skills to pay the
bills. Mini rant over.
So why do I work at Launch Academy?
